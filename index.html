# More than programming

--

Developer role is not only about programming.

--

It is much more.

--

* Being a good team member.

--

* Courage to stand up.

--

* Ethics and responsibility.

--

* Desire to learn and teach new things.

--

* Steadily adding value while minimizing waste.

---

# Software development

--

There are various different

- activities,
    - requirements, design, testing, etc.

--

- paradigms,
    - OO, FP, etc.

--

- models,
    - agile, waterfall, etc.

--

- frameworks,
    - Scrum, Kanban, etc.

---

# Software development

There are various different (cont.)

- methodologies,
    - DevOps, XP, etc.

--

- disciplines,
    - documentation, project management, UX, etc.

--

- practices and
    - CI, DDD, TDD, etc.

--

- tools
    - compilers, IDEs, modeling, etc.

# Human skills

--

We are social beings.

--

We work in teams.

--

We work with the customer.

--

We communicate and interact.

--

This is not to say that one needs to be "people person" or to have excellent social skills.

--

When we talk about human skills we mean it in very broad sense including soft skills and life skills.

--

**Skills that help us to succeed in our daily work** such as:
communication, team work, compassion, listening,
writing, drawing, negotiation, problem solving,
nonviolent communication, psychological safety, etc.

--

*Poor communication is the primary contributor to project failures.*

---

## Positive psychology

--

### Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA)

--

* Wisdom and Knowledge (viisaus ja tieto)
> creativity (luovuus), curiosity (uteliaisuus), open-mindedness/judgement (arviointikyky), love of learning (oppimisen ilo), perspective (näkökulmanottokyky)

--

* Courage (rohkeus)
> bravery (rohkeus (urheus)), persistence/perseverance (sinnikkyys), integrity/honesty (rehellisyys), zest (innostus), (bonus: sisu)

--

* Humanity (inhimillisyys)
> love (rakkaus), kindness (ystävällisyys), social intelligence (sosiaalinen älykkyys), (bonus: compassion (myötätunto))

## Tactical skills

*Tactical skills are the "bread and butter" of software development.
They are typically technical and low-level know-how. It is advisable
to expose oneself to a broad spectrum of these.*

--

Some examples:
* Issue tracking
* Technical documentation tools
* Visualization / diagram tools
* Persistence
  * Sql
  * Nosql
  * Newsql
  * Key-value
  * Column
  * Graph
  * Messaging
  * CAP theorem
  * ACID

---

cont.
* Programming
  * Functional programming
  * Object oriented programming
* Object-relational mapping
* Regular expressions
* Actor model
* Infrastructure
  * Operating systems
  * IDEs / editors
  * Build tools
  * Version control
  * Infrastructure as code / deployment tools
  * CI / CD
  * Virtualization
     * Virtual machines
     * Containers
     * Cloud computing
* Computer security
  * Threat modeling
  * OWASP

---

cont.
* Computer science
  * Concurrency, parallelism, multithreading, asynchronism
  * Algorithms and Data structures
  * AI / ML
  * Data Engineering / Science
  * Programming language theory
     * Parsers
     * Abstract Syntax Tree
     * Meta programming
--

Note, highly advanced tactical skills might lead to complex or hard to under to understand solutions. Clarity is better than cleverness.

# Value

--

Software is valuable when it saves money, makes money or protects revenue.

--

Software is valuable when it's ***easily modifiable***.

---

## Adding value

--

To add value, software usually has to be modified somehow.

--

Easily modifiable implies a short feedback loop where we can quickly observe the modifications, even in production environment.

--

Easy to change also implies quality, since if a change would cause a bug or other unexpected extra work the change was not easy, after all.

--

> **Easier to Change  ⇒  Short Feedback Loop  ⇒  Quality  ⇒  Value**

--

Easily modifiable means to all developers in a team, including newish junior developers (with some gentle guidance, perhaps).

--

If making a change requires extensive experience about the project and senior developer skills, then the software is not easily modifiable.

--

Therefore, it is valuable to maintain or improve software so that it is ***easily modifiable***.

To put it slightly differently: keep technical debt at minimum and automate things.

# Summary

--

(1/3)

**Software development**</br> is a non-trivial in typical real-life project setting. It requires vast amount expertise and experience to know whats effective in any given situation.

--

**Human skills**</br> help us to succeed in our daily work.
This covers many skills such as empathy, communication, teamwork, etc.

--

**Strategic skills**</br> are powerful high level traits, tools, techniques and knowledge how to develop software.
For example, Test Driven Development, Domain Driven Design, Extreme Programming, etc.

--

**Tactical skills**</br> are technical and low-level know-how like programming languages. It is advisable
to expose oneself to a broad spectrum of these.
Balanced skill set with some specific focus areas is recommended.

---

# Summary

(2/3)

**Value**</br> means keeping software **easily modifiable** with short feedback loops and without defects or regressions.
*It's not the value of the feature but the lead time from feature request to production.*

--

**Feedback loops**</br>
are everywhere. Focus on what matters: continuous learning, delivery performance, product success and data driven decisions.


---

# Summary

(3/3)

**How to keep leveling up as a developer?**

--

- Constantly improve **tactical**, **strategic** and **human** skills.

--

- Beginners should focus more on tactical skills. Human skills emphasize usually later on career.

--

- **Easily modifiable** software is **valuable**. Keep it that way.

--

- Fast **feedback loops** are essential.

--

- Focus on the **basics** such as
 - how to reason about code
 - how to make code easy to test
 - how to organize code base
